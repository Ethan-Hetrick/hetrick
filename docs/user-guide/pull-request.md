# Pull Requests
## Best Practices
PR should be created after the first commit from the feature/ or fix/ branch. 

Include a descriptive title, summarizing the components included in the PR. 

The PR template included below, should be included for each PR. 

PRs may be created in draft or review mode. 

Drafts can only be edited by the individual who created them. 

For collaborative branches, review-mode PRâ€™s may be used. 

Upon completion of the PR template and testing, a userd that is not the PR requestor should be assigned as a reviewer, that is not the PR requestor. 

After a review, address any concerns, updating the PR as needed. 

Complete the Code Review cycle until approval is achieved from the reviewer. 

Upon approval from the reviewer, push the branch into dev or main under the following conditions: 

Main: Any break-fixing patch updates 

Dev: All other updates 

Ensure the feature or fix branch has been deleted.
